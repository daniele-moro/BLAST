# BLAST - Blockchain Assisted Transparency
BLAST (Blockchain Assisted Transparency) won the hackathon sponsored by EternityWall, Oraclize and BHB - Blockchainlab: "Bitcoin - building layer2 applications that matter".
The Team was composed by: Alessandro Gattolin ([GitHub](https://github.com/gatb27), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrogattolin/)), Daniele Moro ([GitHib](https://github.com/daniele-moro), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-moro-40944373/)), Marco Frigerio ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcofrigerio/))

We are working on a model that can bring transparency to any industry and any business case.
Our 2-layers architecture is independent from the context and can be built over different kind of permission-less blockchain.

This project is only a Proof of Concept developed during the Hackathon.
